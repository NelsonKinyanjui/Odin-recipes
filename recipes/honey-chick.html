    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The chicken gets tossed in the hot honey you make yourself (which means you can adjust the heat if you want!) and becomes sweet and spicy. Drizzle any extra honey from the pan over the bowls for an extra kick.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       
        <li> 2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced
            1/4 c. rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce
            1 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large sweet potatoes (about 20 oz. total), halved lengthwise, thinly sliced into half-moons
            1 large head of broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        <li>1 c. long-grain white rice, rinsed
            4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 2 lb.)</li>
        <li> 
            1 tsp. chili powder
            1/3 c. honey</li>
        <li>
            1 tbsp. sriracha
            1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        
    </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place cucumbers in a heatproof jar. Add vinegar, soy sauce, granulated sugar, and enough hot water to cover cucumbers. Let sit until ready to use. </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Place potatoes and broccoli on 2 separate baking sheets. Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder; generously season with salt and black pepper and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Roast broccoli and potatoes until broccoli is tender-crisp, about 25 minutes. Toss potatoes and continue to roast until crisp and browned in spots, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over high heat, bring water, rice, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. Reduce heat to low, then cover and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. </li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Season chicken with chili powder, salt, and black pepper on both sides. Cook chicken, turning occasionally, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 165°, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Cut into bite-size pieces. </li>
            <li>Wipe skillet clean. Return to medium heat and cook honey, sriracha, and red pepper flakes, stirring constantly, until honey is warmed through and simmering, about 2 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Divide rice among bowls. Top with chicken, roasted vegetables, and pickled cucumbers. Drizzle hot honey from skillet over bowls. </li>
            <li>Cucumbers can be pickled 2 weeks ahead. Store in jar in refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
