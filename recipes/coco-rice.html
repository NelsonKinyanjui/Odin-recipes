    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coconut milk is truly magical. It turns ordinary rice into a creamy, flavorful, perfectly cooked rice. We're honestly never cooking our rice without it again. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       
        <li> 2 c. white jasmine rice 
            1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (13.66-oz.) Thai Kitchen coconut milk
            1 1/2 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. plus 1 tsp. chopped fresh thyme leaves
            2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. McCormick ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning
            4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 lb.)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. coconut oil, melted
            2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley</li>
        
    </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°. In the bottom of a 3-quart baking dish, combine rice, onion, coconut milk, broth, and 2 tablespoons thyme. Season with 1 ½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and stir to combine. </li>
            <li>Season chicken thighs with ½ teaspoon salt and a large pinch of pepper. Nestle chicken skin side up into rice mixture. Brush exposed chicken with coconut oil and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon thyme.</li>
            <li>Cover dish with foil and bake for 1 hour. Uncover and increase oven to broil. Broil until golden, about 10 more minutes.</li>
